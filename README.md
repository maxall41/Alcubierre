# Alcubierre
A OOP oriented game engine written in Rust. That uses wgpu under the hood to draw graphics. Rapier for physics, and Kira for audio.
Alcubierre is designed to create games *fast*. 

For things like Game Jams. 
It is no where near ready for that use case though. As what it supports is still extremely limited.
